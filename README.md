# DNS & ICMP Traffic Analysis for Incident Response
## Project Overview

This project simulates a real-world incident response scenario where I acted as a cybersecurity analyst for an IT services company. The task was to diagnose why customers of a client, ***yummyrecipesforme.com***, were unable to access the website and were receiving a "destination port unreachable" error.

## Analysis & Findings

I analyzed a network traffic log generated by tcpdump to understand the root cause of the connectivity issue.

- <b>Initial Observation:</b> The log showed that a user's computer sent a DNS query via a UDP packet to resolve the website's domain name. This is a standard first step for a browser when trying to visit a website.

- <b>Problem Identification:</b> Instead of receiving a DNS resolution, the user's computer received an ICMP error message.

- <b>Key Insight:</b> The specific error message was "udp port 53 unreachable". This indicates that the request reached the DNS server's IP address, but no service was listening on Port 53, the standard port for DNS. The server was therefore unable to process the DNS query and used the ICMP protocol to report the error back to the user's machine. The log shows this process repeated multiple times with the same result.

## Outcome
Based on the analysis, I completed a security Incident Report to document the findings for stakeholders and the engineering team. The conclusion was that **the website outage was not caused by an issue with users' computers or the outgoing requests. Instead, the incident was caused by the DNS protocol service being unavailable on the client's server.**

By successfully interpreting the DNS and ICMP traffic, I was able to pinpoint the exact point of failure. This analysis provided the necessary information for the security engineering team to begin remediation efforts on the affected DNS server.
